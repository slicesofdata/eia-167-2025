# Welcome

Welcome to **Electricity Trends Across the U.S. and States**.  
This website explores how electricity demand, pricing, and emissions evolve across the United States, with focused case studies on California, Texas, and Virginia.

Using publicly available data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the site combines data visualizations with narrative explanations to highlight patterns in electricity consumption, sectoral differences, and regional energy challenges. The goal is to make complex energy data more accessible and meaningful for a general audience.

## About This Site

This site serves as a data visualization project designed to communicate trends and comparisons in U.S. electricity systems. Rather than presenting raw datasets or technical tables, the website utilizes clear visual storytelling to help users understand how electricity markets and energy use differ across regions and sectors.

Each page focuses on a specific geographic scope:

- **United States** — national trends in electricity use and prices  
- **California** — energy efficiency, pricing pressures, and emissions  
- **Texas** — demand growth, generation shifts, and market dynamics  
- **Virginia** — regional energy patterns and sectoral differences  

Together, these pages demonstrate how data can be cleaned, analyzed, and visualized to tell a coherent story about energy systems, policy tradeoffs, and economic impacts.
