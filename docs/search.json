    "text": "This page gives an overview of Virginia’s trends in electricity usage and customers by sector.\n\n\nWe chose Virginia as one the United States’s most important electricity markets due to Northern Virginia hosting the largest concentration of data centers in the world. These specialized buildings, which are registered as commercial in Virginia, power computer servers and routers and consume 10 to 50 times more energy per floor space compared to other commercial office buildings. The rise of advanced technologies, including AI, has driven a massive surge in the demand for data centers, which require significant power and specialized infrastructure like liquid cooling.\nBesides data center activity, we also observe a couple of key facts that make Virginia particularly interesting to study:\n\nDominion Electricity, an energy company, supplies electricity to Virginia as well as parts of North Carolina, West Virginia, Pennsylvania etc. The company reveals interesting electricity trends by making detailed data public\nThe Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA, 2020) has mandated a renewable transition for the state, leading to interesting changes in fuel mix\nVirginia demonstrates significant reliance on natural gas – the state’s natural gas consumption is nearly eight times higher than its own production. This makes electricity prices for end consumers sensitive to input fuel price shocks\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(tidyr)  \nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(here)\n\nhere() starts at /Users/milesbrodey/Desktop/Data Visualization/eia-167-2025\n\nsource(here(\"src\",\"data\",\"energy_savings_cleaning_VA.R\"))\n\nWarning: package 'readr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'readr'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:scales':\n\n    col_factor\n\n\nKey stored successfully in package environment.\n\nsource(here(\"src\",\"figs\",\"energy_savings_plot_VA.R\"))\n\n\n\n\nElectricity Prices by Sector\n\n\nThis plot looks at Virginia electricity prices over time for the Residential, Commercial, and Industrial sectors. Each dot represents the average electricity price for that month (cents/kWh) and the smooth lines highlight long-term trends.\nWe see all sectors becoming more expensive over time due to factors we will explore below: fuel price trends, investment in new infrastructure such as data centers, and environmental policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNatural Gas Prices by Sector\n\n\nThis graph shows changes in Virginia’s natural gas prices for the Commercial and Residential sectors affect these customers’ end electricity prices. We can see how input fuel markets affect retail pricing.\nThis graph shows a close relationship between natural gas prices and retail prices. For example, between 2021-2022 when natural gas prices spiked for both sectors, retail prices also followed.\nHowever, in some periods like between 2010 and 2016, where natural gas prices stayed steady, retail prices slowly increased. This suggests there are other factors that affect retail prices, which we will go on to explore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNatural Gas Prices by Sector\n\n\nThis is a stacked bar plot that highlights Virginia’s electricity generation mix for the last five years. It shows what percentage of the state’s electricity was generated from four different fuel types: coal, natural gas, hydroelectric, and solar. Note wind was omitted because an insignificant portion of the state’s electricity comes from this source.\nThis relates back to the earlier plot, demonstrating the state grid’s overwhelming reliance on natural gas. This explains retail price sensitivity to changes in price of this underlying fuel type.\nWe also see evidence of the VCEA at play. From 2020 onwards, renewables (hydroelectric and solar) as a share of the state’s total generation have increased. However, they still remain a small share. Notably, the state has weaned itself off of coal, reflecting retirement of plants that have reached the end of their useful life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommercial Sector Electricity Sales\n\n\nThis shows the commercial sector’s monthly electricity sales for the last five years (orange line) as well as a smoothened line that more clearly shows a long-term trend (pink line).\nThe orange line reflects normal seasonal swings – high electricity needs in the summer from air conditioning and in the winter with heating. We will explore seasonality in plots below.\nThe pink line reflects long-term demand growth primarily driven by data center expansion in Northern Virginia and, to a lesser extent, grid electrification. This pink line also explains the trend we see in retail prices in the commercial sector in the first plot. Above, we see commercial sector prices spike after 2021, which coincides with the demand growth displayed in this plot. This is because of demand pressure on the grid as utilities must expand to meet the needs of this increased baseload.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeasonal Variability (All Sectors)\n\n\nThis is a violin chart which shows the distribution of Virginia’s electricity prices by months over the time period drawn from the API.\nThe shape shows the range of observed prices in the month while the black dot marks the average price (cents/kWh).\nThis plot explains the importance of seasonality on month-to-month changes in retail electricity prices. Virginia displays considerable climate variability. Average prices peak slightly in the summer due to data centers displaying increased server cooling among other factors. In the winter, while there are heating needs, December to February months display slightly narrower and lower price distributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeasonal Variability (by Sector)\n\n\nThis violin plot is an extension of the one above, displaying monthly retail price distributions broken down by sector: residential, commercial, and industrial.\nWe see residential customers face the largest seasonal swings and have the broadest distributions overall. This can be attributed to increased exposure during hot summer months: air conditioning to fight heat waves.\nComparatively, commercial and industrial customers are better buffered against seasonality, with the latter enjoying negotiated high-load contracts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Savings (by Sector)\n\n\nTo end, let’s look at this bar chart. It looks at annual energy savings in Virginia across four sectors: residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation. The API only had data for the years from 2013 to 2019. Energy savings can arise due to multiple factors such as efficiency improvements in building (e.g., light upgrades) or utility-sponsored efficiency programs.\nThis bar chart shows most energy savings were driven by the commercial and industrial sectors. Because these sectors consume large amounts of energy per customer, they present ripe opportunities for energy efficiency gains.\nEnergy savings peaked in 2016. Focus on the commercial and industrial sectors. When looking back at our initial retail prices by sector plot, we see the commercial and industrial sectors didn’t experience retail price growth in 2016. This shows that efficiency gains can be one way of moderating the demand-side inflationary pressures caused by data centers."

    "text": "This part focuses on the U.S electricity prices because the United States gives us a long, well documented, and consistent data set across the sectors. It makes it an ideal baseline to compare the other states to for analyzing national/state trends, and understanding how energy costs have changed over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Midterm version (grouped bar chart).

This design was less effective for long time series, so the final uses line plots to emphasize trends.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is my midterm plot that shows U.S. electricity prices by sector from 2001 to 2024. The x-axis represents the year and the y-axis shows the average price in cents per kilowatt-hour. Each year plotted has three bars that represent residential, commercial, and industrial electricity prices. The results produced show that residential electricity is always the most expensive, commercial prices are lower, and industrial prices are consistently the lowest. Each of these sectors show a clear increase in prices over time, including prices rising more sharply after 2020. This plot’s limitation is that it becomes visually crowded when we are looking at many years. This makes it harder to quickly and easily see overall trends or small year to year changes, and using annual averages hides seasonal fluctuations (we can infer that results could look different in winter vs. summer). My main goal when creating this plot was to show how prices change over time. Therefore, I switched to a line plot for my final plot for this visualization. The line plot makes trends, differences between sectors, and changes over time easier to see and interpret.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: U.S. average electricity prices by sector (2001–2024).

Shaded regions mark the 2008–2009 financial crisis and the COVID-19 period.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot presents U.S. average electricity prices by sector: residential, commercial, and industrial, from 2001 to 2024 using a line plot with points. This plot is a modification of one of my original midterm visualizations, which originally was showing the same data but as a bar plot. Switching my final plot to a line plot was better because it emphasizes trends and changes over time. This makes the visual easier for the audience to compare how prices evolve across the sectors instead of just focusing on individual yearly values. My data in this code is being pulled from the EIA API. It was cleaned using mutate() and filter() to create readable sector labels and remove missing values. Additionally, it was then visualized with geom_line() and geom_point(). There are manual colors and shape scales to clearly distinguish sectors. The shaded regions which were added using annotate(), are highlighting major economic periods, like the 2008–2009 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. This provides important contextual information. A key advantage of this approach is that it clearly shows long run trends and relative differences between sectors. One of the possible limitations from this plot is that annual line plots can create uncertainty over short term variation and may look like smooth continuity even though prices are measured discretely year by year. Overall, the results of this plot show that electricity prices have increased across all sectors over time. Residential prices are consistently the highest, industrial prices the lowest, and a noticeable acceleration in growth after 2020. It is also important to note that there were changes during the 2008–2009 financial crisis and a more obvious increase (seen in the plot) from the COVID-19 pandemic. This was extremely noticeable in residential and commercial users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Percent change in U.S. electricity prices by sector relative to the 2001 baseline (2001 = 0%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Percent change in U.S. electricity prices by sector relative to the 2001 baseline (2001 = 0%).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis line chart illustrates the percent change in average U.S. electricity prices by sector, residential, commercial, and industrial, from 2001 to 2024, with 2001 normalized to zero on the y-axis. The x axis like the other plots is representing years, while the y-axis here shows the percentage change in prices relative to the 2001 baseline. Each point corresponds to a sector’s average annual electricity price in a given year, and the connected lines highlight long term trends. Looking across all sectors, electricity prices rise substantially, the main finding is that the trends move apart over time. Residential prices increase the most, especially after 2020, reaching nearly 90% above 2001 levels by 2024, while commercial and industrial prices grow more gradually and remain closer together at roughly 55–65% above the baseline. Some of the patterns we can see include steady growth through the 2000s, a relative flatness across much of the mid 2010s, and then a sharp acceleration in the early 2020s seen primarily by residential prices. A key takeaway is that households have experienced disproportionately larger electricity price increases compared to businesses and industry. Again, this data were retrieved using the EIA R package to pull annual U.S. retail electricity prices by sector from the EIA API, and then cleaned and reshaped with dplyr, normalized by computing sector-specific percent changes relative to 2001, and then using ggplot 2 to plot using manually defined colors, shapes, and formatted axes for clarity. A limitation to point out is that the figures reflect annual averages, which mask seasonal fluctuations and short-term volatility, and the visualization is descriptive rather than causal, showing price trends without explaining their underlying drivers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Electricity price trends for the U.S., California, Texas, and Virginia (2001–2024) with LOESS trends, uncertainty bands, and peak labels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Electricity price trends for the U.S., California, Texas, and Virginia (2001–2024) with LOESS trends, uncertainty bands, and peak labels.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis next final plot I have is a faceted plot that is comparing the annual average retail electricity prices (¢/kWh) from 2001 through the latest available year (2024) for the United States, California, Texas, and Virginia. Using eia_data() from the eia package, I pulled annual state-level price data, cleaned it with mutate() (extracting year, recoding state, and converting price to numeric), and then used ggplot() to layer gray points for each observed year with a colored LOESS smooth (geom_smooth(method=“loess”, se=TRUE, span=0.6)) which was used to highlight the overall trend and show an uncertainty band. Even though prices are annual averages, the EIA reports many observations per year across different reporting units. This is why there are several gray points that appear for each year rather than just a single value. This is when the LOESS. curve smooths over to show the overall trend and the uncertainty. This is because there are multiple prices recorded for the same year. The results of this plot show visual differences across regions. First, California increases the most and peaks around 32¢/kWh in 2024. Next, Texas remains lower and relatively flat followed by Virginia is a steadier path closer to the national average. The peak prices are highlighted by identifying the highest value for each state and labeling it directly on the plot. One of the limitations of this plot is that the data are annual averages, which prevents us from seeing seasonal variation, and the LOESS trend only describes patterns rather than causes. This could be improved by using monthly or inflation-adjusted data and adding another variable, such as demand, to help us explain why the prices differ across states."

Using eia_data() from the eia package, I pulled annual state-level price data, cleaned it with mutate() (extracting year, recoding state, and converting price to numeric), and then used ggplot() to layer gray points for each observed year with a colored LOESS smooth (geom_smooth(method=“loess”, se=TRUE, span=0.6)) which was used to highlight the overall trend and show an uncertainty band. Even though prices are annual averages, the EIA reports many observations per year across different reporting units. This is why there are several gray points that appear for each year rather than just a single value. This is when the LOESS. curve smooths over to show the overall trend and the uncertainty. This is because there are multiple prices recorded for the same year. The results of this plot show visual differences across regions. First, California increases the most and peaks around 32¢/kWh in 2024. Next, Texas remains lower and relatively flat followed by Virginia is a steadier path closer to the national average. The peak prices are highlighted by identifying the highest value for each state and labeling it directly on the plot. One of the limitations of this plot is that the data are annual averages, which prevents us from seeing seasonal variation, and the LOESS trend only describes patterns rather than causes. This could be improved by using monthly or inflation-adjusted data and adding another variable, such as demand, to help us explain why the prices differ across states."

    "text": "Background: California Energy Context\nCalifornia plays a central role in U.S. energy discussions because it is both one of the largest energy consumers and a national leader in renewable energy policy. Its ambitious clean energy goals, including targets for carbon neutrality by 2045 and large-scale adoption of solar and wind power, have reshaped how energy is produced, distributed, and priced across the state. California’s energy sector is characterized by a large residential customer base alongside major industrial and commercial users. These efforts to decarbonize and modernize the grid often contribute to higher electricity prices. A major challenge that California faces is the necessity for massive investment in safer infrastructure to help protect against wildfires. These costs are not only incurred by utilities, but are also passed on to consumers.The data used for this analysis come from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)."

The residential trend line remains relatively stable over time, suggesting steady population growth and consistent electricity demand across households. However, the residential data points also display greater variation, indicating fluctuations that may be driven by seasonal demand shifts, changing energy efficiency programs, or adoption of distributed energy resources like rooftop solar. In contrast, commercial and industrial accounts show slower and smaller increases, reflecting the relatively limited number of large-scale energy consumers in California’s economy. The visual gap between the lines emphasizes how dominant the residential sector is in shaping California’s overall energy usage patterns. This composition highlights the importance of residential energy policy in achieving the state’s broader efficiency and sustainability goals."

CHP systems simultaneously produce electricity and useful heat from a single fuel source, making them far more energy efficient than separate heat and power generation. The data reveal that CHP generation is overwhelmingly concentrated in the industrial sector, which consistently accounts for the vast majority of total output. This reflects the sector’s heavy energy needs and its economic incentive to adopt efficiency measures that reduce waste heat and energy costs. In contrast, the commercial sector contributes only a small share, indicating that CHP adoption in smaller-scale facilities has been more limited. The gradual decline in total CHP output in recent years may point to shifts toward cleaner, grid-based renewables and changing industrial activity patterns. Overall, the dominance of industrial CHP underscores California’s focus on improving energy efficiency within its largest and most energy-intensive operations."

The industrial sector consistently produces the vast majority of emissions across all fuels, reflecting its heavier energy demands and dependence on combustion-based processes. Natural gas dominates the state’s emissions profile, with industrial emissions peaking in the mid-2000s before gradually declining. Coal-related emissions have nearly disappeared over time with only the industrial sector still utilizing coal. Petroleum emissions show greater year-to-year variability, particularly within the industrial sector, but remain significantly lower than natural gas. Residential and commercial emissions are comparatively minimal across all fuels, emphasizing the extent to which California’s industrial base drives fuel-related CO₂ emissions. Collectively, these trends illustrate the state’s transition toward cleaner energy sources and reductions in carbon intensity across multiple sectors."

Each box plot summarizes the annual spread of monthly prices, highlighting both long-term trends and the variability in each customer group. Residential customers face the highest and most rapidly rising prices, with noticeable acceleration after 2020. This reflects a combination of factors, including wildfire mitigation costs, infrastructure upgrades, and increasing adoption of distributed energy resources. Commercial customers experience steady but moderate price growth, with seasonal variability impacting monthly prices. Industrial customers face the lowest rates due to negotiated high-load contracts and more stable usage patterns, though they too see a gradual upward trend over time. The widening gap between residential and nonresidential prices underscores the increasing financial burden placed on households as California pursues grid resiliency, decarbonization, and safety investments. Together, these distributions show how price pressures differ across sectors and how statewide energy policies impact customer-level electricity costs."

    "text": "Since the early 2000s, Texas has seen steady growth in electricity demand and evolving price and supply dynamics. The deregulated market (largely under Electric Reliability Council of Texas — ERCOT) has fostered competitive retail offerings and increased consumer choice.Residential electricity prices, which were relatively modest in the mid-2000s, gradually rose through the 2010s and into the early 2020s.Meanwhile, generation capacity has shifted significantly: Texas has emerged as a national leader in wind and solar power, while natural-gas and coal generation still play large roles.The state also faced important reliability tests, notably the February 2021 winter storm that led to widespread outages, prompting regulatory and infrastructure reforms. More recently, wholesale prices remain higher than many past years, demand is sharply increasing (especially driven by data-centers, cooling loads and industrial growth), and forecasts indicate these pressures may push up bills or require further investment in grid infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis visualization shows how electricity consumption in Texas has evolved over time across the commercial, industrial, and residential sectors. While all three sectors display relatively modest fluctuations for most of the period, the recent downward trend especially visible in industrial and residential usage highlights a notable shift in year-over-year demand.
