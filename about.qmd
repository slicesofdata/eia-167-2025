Our project analyzes the long-term electricity trends in the United States of America and is comparing how economic, policy, and energy mixed factors have shaped prices in California, Texas, Virginia, and the US as a whole from 2001 until the mid 2020s using the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data. We were able to collect our data using the EIA API. Combining sector level price analysis with a few state specific case studies on emissions, natural gas dependance, and demand growth, helped our project highlight why electricity costs and other energy resources have evolved differently across various regions and sectors.

## Why This Project Matters

Our project matters and our audience should pay attention because electricity prices are affecting household affordability, industrial competitiveness, and what pace clean energy transition is at. This makes it crucial to understand why costs rise differently across different states and sectors. By looking at price trends and policy choices together, as well as fuel mixes and demand growth, our analysis creates insights that can positively inform more effective and equitable energy policy decisions.
