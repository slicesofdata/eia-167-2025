# Virginia Electricity Trends

This page gives an overview of Virginia's trends in electricity usage and customers by sector.


## Background: Virginia Energy Context

Virginia is an interesting state to examine electricity for a couple of reasons:

-   Unlike fully deregulated states like Texas, Virginia operates under a regulated monopoly model, which means prices reflect both market factors and policy decisions

-   Virginia, through the Virginia Clean Economy Act, is shifting from fossil fuels towards renewables. This change can be examined through looking at changes in fuel input mixes.

-   Northern Virginia is the largest data center market in the world, constituting 13 percent of all reported data center operational capacity globally and 25 percent of capacity in the Americas. Demand growth caused by data centers is pressuring new capacity planning and transmission upgrades, which may affect prices for industrial as well as residential customers through increased system-wide costs.
