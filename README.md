# Project

Data visualization: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)

## Description

This project is for data communication using Energy data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). 

Recommended approach: electricity, https://www.eia.gov/electricity 

Data are provided annually, quarterly, and monthly, which provides the most detail. To browse data availability, see https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/browser/ 

To avoid manual access to data using the data browser, a helpful R library is {eia}. For instructions on installing and loading the library as well as using the API, see https://github.com/ropensci/eia

Using the {eia} library will require an API key from https://www.eia.gov/opendata/register.php
